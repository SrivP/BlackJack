Wanna hear a joke?, ME!
Why did the taxi driver get fired? Passengers didn't like it when she went the extra mile.
It's always windy in a sports arena. All those fans.
What is worse than raining cats and dogs? Hailing taxis!
Why are some magazines so sad? They have too many issues!
What do you call a sad cup of coffee? Depresso!
Why did the beers get married? Because they were pitcher perfect.
I'm the best dealer at this casino, and you played against me, I'm so sad it's over! (how's this a joke?)
